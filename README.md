# LobotomyRelocateAgents

1. Press 'H' to send all agents back to their sefira (department)
2. Press 'Shift + H' to send all agents back to their sefira, but the nearest passage instead of the main room.
3. Hold 'Shiftâ€˜ when clicking the 'recall' button to gather all your agents to the sefira.

> This mod will simply change the waiting passage of every agent, which means the agent will go to the target position after he has done the work even if he was managing/suppressing creatures at the moment.
